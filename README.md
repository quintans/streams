# streams
a go2 stream PoC

Stream library in go2 with generics.

This work was inspired by https://github.com/jvanbruegge/Building-a-stream-library-from-scratch/blob/master/src/index.ts.

It works both with synchronous or asynchronous streams.

To test it, just copy stream.go2 into https://go2goplay.golang.org/ and run it
